## Advent of Code 2023 Story

> Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.
> 
> You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.
